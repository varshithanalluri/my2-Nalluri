## My favorite vacation spot is USA
Good Service ,**lean – People who** have **visited the third world will** attest to the fact that you can be fairly .<br>confident that the food won’t make you sick and you can drink the water from the tap in most places.<br> Whatever your experience*while visiting the US, it’s worth at least one stop to change (or confirm) your beliefs* about the place.Everything Can Be A Tourist Attraction........
